## Acousto-optics in Optical Waveguides under Mechanical Stress

**brillouin_fibre** is a simulation environment for calculating Stimulated Brillouin Spectrum (SBS) for a 2-D Optical Waveguide in the presence of external mechanical load. Built over the [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) computing platform or solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with the finite element method (FEM), **brillouin_fibre** combines the linear elastic equation, Maxwell's equations and the elastodynamic equations to fully characterize optical waveguides built from any material. The sequence can be described with the following workflow:
